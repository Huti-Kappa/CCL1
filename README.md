# **Kregenone**

> Kregenone is a rhythm-based battle game set in a medieval fantasy colosseum. You, the player, must fight through three intense battles by timing your attacks to incoming rhythm-based prompts. The game's pixel-art aesthetic is heavily inspired by Undertale. This project was created for the first CCL.
